# Venomous Workflow

A workflow engine implemented mainly based on the third-party library [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) v12.

The Venomous UI Workflow component is designed using the Singleton pattern, which is optimal for scenarios where a single workflow instance is required per page. It is recommended to use only one workflow instance per page to avoid confusion caused by shared state.
