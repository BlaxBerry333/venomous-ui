# Venomous UI

A lightweight, cross-framework UI component library.

## Why Venomous UI?

There are many excellent UI libraries out there, each with its own strengths. However, during daily development, I've encountered some friction points that led me to explore alternatives:

<StoryDocsTable
  headers={["Library Type", "Personal Pain Points"]}
  rows={[
    ["Ant Design / MUI", "Bundle size concerns, style overrides often need !important, locked to one framework"],
    ["Chakra / Mantine", "Runtime CSS-in-JS adds complexity for SSR, style props mixed with component logic"],
    ["Radix / Headless UI", "Great flexibility but requires building styles from scratch every time"],
    ["Tailwind-based", "Works well, but utility classes can reduce code readability in complex components"],
  ]}
/>

This project started as a personal learning exercise and a way to address my specific preferences. It's not meant to replace mainstream libraries — they're battle-tested and feature-rich. Instead, Venomous UI is an attempt to find a balance that works for my workflow:

- **Zero Runtime CSS** - Pure CSS with variables, avoiding runtime overhead and SSR complexity
- **Cross-framework** - Sharing the same API between React and Vue projects I work on
- **Optional Built-in Styles** - Ready to use out of the box, but easy to replace entirely
- **Simple Customization** - CSS variables make theming straightforward without deep selector chains
- **Readable Class Names** - Semantic names like `.venomous-button--solid` help with debugging
- **Minimal Footprint** - Import only what's needed, keeping bundles lean

## Installation

<StoryDocsTabCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "npm",
      language: "bash",
      code: `npm install github:BlaxBerry333/venomous-ui#release`,
    },
    {
      label: "yarn",
      language: "bash",
      code: `yarn add github:BlaxBerry333/venomous-ui#release`,
    },
    {
      label: "pnpm",
      language: "bash",
      code: `pnpm add github:BlaxBerry333/venomous-ui#release`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Quick Start

<StoryDocsTabCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "React",
      language: "tsx",
      code: `"use client";

import { Button } from "venomous-ui/react";
import "venomous-ui/core/styles/variables/index.css";
import "venomous-ui/core/styles/components/button.css";

export default function App() {
  return <Button variant="solid">Click me</Button>;
}`,
    },
    {
      label: "Vue",
      language: "html",
      code: `<script setup lang="ts">
import { Button } from "venomous-ui/vue";
import "venomous-ui/core/styles/variables/index.css";
import "venomous-ui/core/styles/components/button.css";
</script>

<template>
  <Button variant="solid">Click me</Button>
</template>`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Customizing Theme

Override CSS variables to customize the theme:

<Source
  language="css"
  dark
  code={`:root {
  --VENOMOUSUI-color-primary: #your-color;
  --VENOMOUSUI-color-primary-hover: #your-hover-color;
}`}
/>

For convenience, we provide a TypeScript object `CSS_VARS` that maps to CSS variable values, allowing you to use them in JavaScript:

<StoryDocsTabCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "React",
      language: "tsx",
      code: `import { CSS_VARS } from "venomous-ui/core/constants";

// Use in inline styles

<div style={{ color: CSS_VARS.colorTheme }}>
  Theme colored text
</div>`,
    },
    {
      label: "Vue",
      language: "html",
      code: `<script setup lang="ts">
import { CSS_VARS } from "venomous-ui/core/constants";
</script>

<template>
  <div :style="{ color: CSS_VARS.colorTheme }">
    Theme colored text
  </div>
</template>`,
    },
  ]}
/>
